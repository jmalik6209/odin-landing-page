# odin-landing-page

## Project Description: 

This is a project I am doing as a part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It is the second one of the course, and is a landing page for a business/website. The website includes different elements styled and organized using more advanced HTML/CSS concepts such as flexbox, more intricate styling, and other display types. I hope you enjoy it!

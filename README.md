# odin-landing-page

## Project Description: 

This is a project I am doing as a part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It is the second one of the course, and is a landing page for a business/website. The website includes different elements styled and organized using more advanced HTML/CSS concepts such as flexbox, more intricate styling, and other display types. I hope you enjoy it!

## Additional Notes:

Although this landing page is meant to be a solution to the assignment which was to "clone" a given image of a page, it is possible that I expand this into a full website in the future. In the meantime, feel free to leave suggestions or use this template landing page as inspiration for your own website :)
